        Why backspace/correction is not allowed?
    </div>
    <div class="help-a">
        <p>
            Backspace/correction is not supported because as a beginner it takes away the accuracy. If we feel we can correct an error, we will always type something wrongly with the hope of correcting it later. This makes a huge impact on accuracy and affects the learning process. So this feature is intentional.

        How to differentiate between Caps and Small keys in the key glow?
    </div>
    <div class="help-a">
        <p>
            Key glows correspond to the most recent key press (i.e glowing the most recently pressed character out of the two characters for the same key in the keyboard). From the key glows, you can visually differentiate capital letters from small letters, numbers from special characters, top row special characters from bottom row special characters in the onscreen keys, thus enabling you to visually identify the accuracy of the right key during the progress of the course.
        </p>

        <p>
            Capital letters are denoted by a small dash above and below the character. If the most recently pressed key is a capital letter, you can identify with this visual differentiation.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get the detailed statistics on both the keys, you can pause the application and refer to the live statistics window.
