					<div class = "page-header"><h1>Overview</h1></div><p class = "lead">This section gives an overview of different features of Hotcold Typing. Detailed explanation can be found in further sections.</p>	<ul>
						<li><strong>Key glows : </strong>In <em>Hot-cold Typing</em>, as you type in the course window, your onscreen keys glow in different colors depending on the current accuracy of the corresponding key. There are a total of <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Detailed explanation in 'understanding key glows' section">8 color shades</a>, each representing a different accuracy range from 0 to 100%. </li>
						<li><strong>Differentiating key glows : </strong>Key glows correspond to the most recent key press (i.e glowing the most recently pressed character out of the two characters for the same key in the keyboard). From the key glows, you can visually differentiate capital letters from small letters, numbers from special characters, top row special characters from bottom row special characters in the onscreen keys, thus enabling you to visually identify the accuracy of the right key during the progress of the course.</li>
						<li><strong>finger highlight : </strong>an image mimicking human hand with fingers is present to indicate the course taker on appropriate fingers for the keys.</li>
						<li><strong>Key highlight : </strong>The key to be typed is highlighted in the virtual keyboard. Also, keys in the lesson window (window holding the course text) which are typed right are highlighted in green, and keys typed wrong are highlighted in red.
</li>
						<li><strong>Live graphs : </strong>Live graphs on accuracy, gross and net typing speed are drawn during the progress of the course.</li>
						<li><strong>Live statistics : </strong>The key statistics are prepared and presented at the end of every keypress.</li>
						<li><strong>Automatic pausing : </strong>The application pauses automatically after 8 seconds of typing inactivity. For example, if a person does not type anything for 8 seconds, the application pauses automatically. It is important to note that, mouse movements are not considered for this functionality.</li>
						<li><strong>Manual pausing : </strong>The application can also be paused and resumed at will depending on the convenience of the course taker.</li>
						<li><strong>Dynamic course creation : </strong>You can easily create a course of their choice on the fly. All you have to do is to enter some course text and choose a time from the options. Once done, you can enjoy learning with all these features for your own course.</li>

					<h3>Differentiating capital from small letters:</h3>
					It is important to remember that key glows correspond to the most recent key press (i.e glowing the most recently pressed character out of the two characters for the same key in the keyboard). You can differentiate capital letters from small letters from the key glows, and identify to which particular character the key glow corresponds to. Capital letters are denoted by a <strong> small dash above and below the character.
					
					For example: after typing "EXAMPLE", the keys look like </strong><div class = "example_holder"><span class = "hotcold-letter e o_line">e<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter x o_line">x<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter yellow o_line">a<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter l-demo o_line">m<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter m o_line">p<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter p o_line">l<br/> </span><span class = "hotcold-letter e-red o_line">e<br/> </span>
					
					<strong>Notice the small dash above and below the letters. This means the most recently pressed key is a capital letter.</strong>
					</div>
					<h3>Differentiating special characters and numbers:</h3>
					Following special characters are differentiated by a <strong>top and bottom dash</strong> : _, +, {, }, :, ", |, <, >, ?. 
					
					<div class = "alert alert-success text-center">Note that all these characters occupy top position in the keyboard.</div> 
					The corresponding bottom position symbols (-, =, [, ], ;, ', \, comma, period, /) are indicated without any dashes. The keys appear in the normal way.
					<strong>For example: after typing " { ] ", the keys look like </strong>
					<div class = "example_holder"><span class = "hotcold-letter e o_line">{<br/>[</span><span class = "hotcold-letter x">}<br/>]</span>
					
					<strong>Notice the small dash above and below the letters indicate top row symbol. No dashes indicate bottom row symbol.</strong>
					</div>
					Numbers are denoted by an <strong>underscore. For example typing "1234%^&" look like</strong>
					<div class = "example_holder"><span class = "hotcold-letter e">!<br/><span class = "u_line">1</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter x">@<br/><span class = "u_line">2</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter yellow">#<br/><span class = "u_line">3</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter l-demo">$<br/><span class = "u_line">4</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter m">%<br/><span class = "">5</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter p">^<br/><span class = "">6</span></span><span class = "hotcold-letter e-red">&<br/><span class = "">7</span></span>
					
					<strong>Notice that numbers have an underscore. No underscore in number keys denote corresponding top position symbols.</strong>
					</div>
					
					<div class = "alert alert-info"><strong>Remember easy : </strong>When the keys have symbols in both top and bottom row, top row symbols are indicated by dash above and below them. No dashes indicate bottom row symbols.</div>	
					<div class = "alert alert-success"><strong>Remember easy : </strong>When the keys have symbols in top row and numbers in bottom row, numbers are indicated by an underscore. No formatting indicates top row symbols.</div>

				<div id = "u-graphs" class = "">
					<div class = "page-header"><h1>Understanding live graphs</h1></div><p class = "lead">There are 2 live graph windows. One for accuracy, and another for speed. Speed graph has two indications : Net speed and Gross speed.</p>
				</div>
					<strong>Live Accuracy graph:</strong>
					
					This graph shows your overall accuracy during the course. The graph starts at the start of the course, and ends when the course time is completly over. When the course is completed ahead of time, saved time is highlighted in the graph.

A thick reference line is presented at the graph to indicate 90% accuracy. This line can be used to visually identify whether your accuracy is greater than 90%. Also thin pale lines are present for each every 10% accuracy increase starting from 10%. The bottom of the graph indicates 0% accuracy, and top of the graph indicates 100% accuracy.

					
					Let us be clear about some technical terms.
					
					<strong>Gross speed (WPM)</strong> - Gross speed indicates the number of words (right or wrong) you can type in a minute. The unit WPM indicates words per minute. 
					 
	<strong>Net Speed (WPM)</strong> - Gross speed indicates the number of right words you can type in a minute. The unit WPM indicates words per minute. 
	
					<div class = "alert alert-success"><strong>Difference between gross and net speed :</strong> In touch typing, typically 5 characters constitute a word, and this 5 character word is used to calculate your speed. For example: Let a person type a 100 word course in a pace of say, 30 words per minute; But he types it completely wrong. Then his Net speed is 0 (zero). What this means is, effectively it is equivalent to that person not having typed anything. Net speed is the ultimate indicator one should focus while learning touch typing. In Hot-cold Typing, Net speed is indicated in green and gross speed in orange.</div>					<div class = "alert"><strong>Note : </strong>It is important to note that wrongly typed characters cannot be undone in Hotcold Typing !</div> <div class = "alert alert-info"><strong>Note : </strong>Before starting the course, the accuracy is displayed as 100%. This means if the course taker typed nothing his accuracy is shown as 100% (but the speed will be 0).</div>
				<strong>Live Speed graph:</strong>
				
				This graph shows your gross and net speed during the course. The graph starts at the start of the course, and ends when the course time is completly over. When the course is completed ahead of time, saved time is highlighted in the graph. Net speed is drawn in green, and gross speed is drawn in orange. If the net speed is equal to gross speed (ie when your accuracy is closer to 100%), only net speed(green line) is visible in the graph.

A thick reference line is presented at the graph to indicate the speed of 40 WPM (40 words per minute, average speed for touch typing). This line can be used to visually identify whether your accuracy is greater than 40WPM. The bottom of the graph indicates a speed of 0 WPM, and top of the graph indicates a speed of 100 WPM (speed above that is normally very rare, and if achieved will not be showed). 

<div class = "alert alert-info"><strong>Note : </strong>Before starting the course, the speeds are displayed and drawn as 0.</div>

				<div id = "u-statistics" class = "">
				<div class = "page-header"><h1>Understanding live statistics</h1></div><p class = "lead">Live key statistics are prepared and updated in the bottom right window of the interface.</p>
					The key statistics are prepared and presented at the end of every keypress. Following information are presented in the key statistics:
					
	<strong>key</strong> - name of the key (eg: A, [, 3, % etc).
	
	<strong>Hits</strong> - total number of times the character has appeared in the course so far.
	
	<strong>Correct</strong> - total number of correct attempts so far for the particular character.
	
	<strong>Accuracy %</strong> - A value between 0 and 100 indicating your accuracy for the particular key.
	
	Each key statistic line is displayed in a color that is similar to the color scheme described in 'Understanding key glows' section. <strong>For example, if the accuracy of key "E" is 93%, it will look like </strong>
				<div class = "example_holder live_data"><div class = "live_data_label">    <span>key</span>	      <span>Hits</span>	     <span>correct</span>	<span>Accuracy %</span></div>

The statistics will be updated after every keypress. The color of the line depends on the accuracy of the key, and if follows the color scheme described in 'Understanding key glows' section.</div>
				<div class = "alert alert-info"><strong>Info : </strong>The key statistics are ordered from worst accuracy to best accuracy.
